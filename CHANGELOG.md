## v9.1.0
Feb 5 2021
{:.heading.post-date}

Version 9.1 provides minor design changes, new features, and closes multiple issues:

### Added

*   Code blocks now can have headers:

    ~~~js
    // file: 'hello-world.js'
    console.log('Hello World!');
    ~~~

    To add the headers, simply make the first line a comment of the form `file: "dir/filename.ext"`.

    * Code blocks now have a copy-to-clipboard button
  
*   Resumes can now have download buttons.

    ![Download Buttons](/assets/img/blog/9.1.0-3.png){:.border.lead width="1776" height="258" loading="lazy"}

    Add the following to the front matter. Note that the PDF needs to be pre-generated. 
    See [the docs](docs/basics.md#downloads) for more.

    ```yml
    # file: "resume.md"
    buttons:
      print: true
      pdf: /assets/Resume.pdf
      vcf: http://h2vx.com/vcf/<!--url-->
      json: /assets/resume.json
    ```

*   Added breadcrumbs above page title:

    ![Breadcrumbs](/assets/img/blog/9.1.0-2.png){:.border.lead width="1588" height="164" loading="lazy"}

    Note that this requires a [directory-like URL pattern](https://qwtel.com/posts/software/urls-are-directories/) like `/blog/:categories/:year-:month-:day-:title/` (default for Hydejack).

    Disable with `hydejack.no_breadcrumbs`.

*   Added "Last modified at" to post layout:

    ![Last modified at](/assets/img/blog/9.1.0-1.png){:.border.lead width="1254" height="218" loading="lazy"}

    To enable this feature, the post needs to have a `last_modified_at` property with a valid date. You can either set it manually in the frontmatter (not recommended), or use the [`jekyll-last-modified-at` plugin](https://github.com/gjtorikian/jekyll-last-modified-at) to set it for you (Not available on GitHub Pages!). 

    You can remove this element by setting `hide_last_modified` in the front matter. You can disable it for all posts by setting `hydejack.hide_last_modified` in the config file. Setting `hydejack.hide_dates` (PRO version only) will also remove it, together with all other time-related UI elements.

    You can customize the hover text, icon, and date format in `_data/strings.yml` using the following keys: `last_modified_at` (hover text), `last_modified_at_icon` (icon name, default: `icon-history`) and `date_formats.last_modified_at` (date format, default: `%Y-%m-%d`).

* Added option to "invert" / darken the font colors in the sidebar. This enables use of bright sidebar images. 
  Set `invert_sidebar: true` in the font matter to enable. Use `defaults` in the config file to enable this for all pages.

* Added a demo of [Clap Button](https://getclaps.app/) during development.
* Added option to configure border radius
* Added dingbat to `page` layout
* Added `plain` layout that comes without a dingbat
* Added `smaller` and `larger` CSS classes that set the font size to the respective values.
* Added options to change the file paths to favicon and apple touch icon in the confog file. Use `favicon` and `apple_touch_icon` respectively.

### Changed
* Added border radius to many elements
* Modernized table design
* [PRO] Setting `hydejack.advertise: false` will now remove the banner from the HTML and the JavaScript console.
* Changed the box shadow of cards (projects, posts) to reduce the amount of painting the browser has to do on when mouse hovering them.
* The layout when using the theme without the `no_break_layout` setting is now


### Fixes
* Allow transparent project and post images
* Removing/leaving out the `logo` key in the config file will now correctly remove the logo from the sidebar
* [PRO] Fixed a bug that caused blog posts to be included the the search even when set to `sitemap: false` in the front matter.

### Major
*   Added Built-In Search Functionality

    Hydejack now has its own built-in search solution, that integrates well with the existing page style and the new navbar. 
   
    The solution is entirely browser-based which means it even works while offline and doesn't depend on an 3rd party. 
    This works, because Hydejack is designed for personal sites that generally have less than 1000 pages. 
    In my testing, Jekyll build times have been a problem long before search query times.
   
    The results of the search are surprisingly good
